\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to all the people who helped me along this journey.
First of all, I want to acknowledge my supervisor Ms. Aline Sprunger for her guidance on mathematical research and her valuable feedback.
Further, I would like to thank Dr. Gabriele Röger of the university of Basel for teaching me the basics of the theory of computer science and sparking my interest in this domain.
My sincere appreciation goes to Dr. Richard Královi\v{c} who gave me good tips for where to start my research.
I am also deeply grateful to my family for their support during stressful moments, and especially to my mother, who also reached out to her colleagues for reviews and gave me feedback on this document herself.
More thanks go to all the people who accepted to review this document and who gave me useful feedback.
I particularly value the time that Hannah Oss and Julia Gygax invested and their detailed and helpful feedback on many details I had missed.
