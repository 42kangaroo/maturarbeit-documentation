\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to all the people who helped me on this journey.
First of all, I want to thank my supervisor Aline Sprunger for her guidance on mathematical research and valuable feedback.
Further, I would like to thank Dr. Gabriele RÃ¶ger of the university of Basel for teaching me the basics of the theory of computer science and sparking my interest in this domain.
I am also deeply grateful to my family for their support during stressful moments.
Another thanks goes to all the people who accepted to reread this work and who gave me useful feedback.
